1. **What is Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)?**
   - OOPs is a programming paradigm where the complete software operates as a bunch of objects talking to each other. An object is a collection of data and the methods which operate on that data.

2. **Why OOPs?**
   - Better manageable code.
   - OOPs helps users to understand the software easily, even if they don’t know the actual implementation.
   - Even very big software can be easily written and managed easily using OOPs.

3. **What are some major Object Oriented Programming languages?**
   - Java, C++, Javascript, Python.

4. **What is a Class?**
   - It is like a blueprint or template of objects. It is a user-defined data type that contains the data members and member functions that operate on the data members.

5. **What is an Object?**
   - An object is an instance of a class. It contains the instance of the members and behaviors defined in the class template.

6. **What are the main features of OOPs?**
   - Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance.

7. **What is Encapsulation?**
   - Wrapping up the implementation of the data member & methods in a class.
     Example: Car has features like accelerator, brake, and it has members like seat tires.

8. **What is Abstraction?**
   - It means showing only the necessary information and hiding the other irrelevant information from the user. Abstraction is implemented using classes and interfaces.
     Example: Hiding the internal working of TV and focusing on Sound, Visuals, Power Input, Channels Input.

9. **What is Polymorphism?**
   - "Polymorphism" means having many forms. In C++ language, we can define multiple functions having the same name but different working depending on the context.
     - **Compile Time Polymorphism / Static Polymorphism / Overloading / Early Binding**
       - Same name but TYPES, ARGUMENTS, RETURN TYPE, ORDERING can be Different.
     - **RunTime Polymorphism / Dynamic Polymorphism / Overriding / Late Binding**
       - When the function name and parameters are the same in the superclass and the child class, it’s called overriding.

10. **What is Inheritance?**
    - In which one class receives the property of another class.
      - Good for code reusability and to achieve Runtime Polymorphism.
